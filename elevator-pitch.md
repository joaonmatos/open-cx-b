# **Cardy 🅱️**'s Elevator Pitch

Have you recently been to a conference? How many business cards did you collect?

If I had to hazard a guess, it was a pain in the ass to  store them all, and to follow up on them.

Our new system, Cardy 🅱️, is going to solve just that. Just pull out your 
smartphone and scan their badge, and you'll get their cards just like that.

You can also get your card out as a sponsor or speaker and have custom 
styling. Want an adventure? Contact us for info.
